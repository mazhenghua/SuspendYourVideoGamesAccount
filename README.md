# Suspend Your Video Games Account
 
Confronted by important business yet can't help messing around? This repo keeps you from your video games account for some time.

## Instructions
1. Set the date & time you would like to access to your account again;
2. Create a new recovery e-mail, use NO recovery method (in my case, protonmail);
3. Set a random password, which is impossible to remenber, for the new e-mail ;
4. Change the password of your video game account, on a similar basis;
5. Fill the account details above;
6. Export the project as an executable file;
7. DELETE src files;
8. Keep the executable file CAREFULLY. 

Your password as well as the recovery e-mail will be unavailable until the designated time.
Works well on myself.

#### This repo is just for fun. There is no guarantee for your account security, etc.
